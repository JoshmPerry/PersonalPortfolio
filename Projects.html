                <div class="SectionDescription Description"><a href=”https://mouselessmouse.com/”>Mouseless Mouse</a> is a glove that transforms hand rotation into mouse movement. It utilizes a BNO086 sensor to calculate the glove's absolute position, then transforms the angle change from resting position into movement. For buttons, the glove has capacitive buttons along the side of each non appendable finger. After connecting this bluetooth device, you enable a new dimension of movement and experience immersion similar to VR. Our code is currently open source <a href=”https://github.com/aggie-coding-club/mouseless-mouse”>here</a> and we're making a web page to demo it <a href=”https://mouselessmouse.com/beta/demo/”>here</a>.</div>

                <div class="SectionDescription Description">As the inventor of Mouseless Mouse, I have pushed the project beyond an idea and through each iteration. Going into the 4th semester of development, each semester has had incredible improvements to the design.<br>Shortly after arriving at A&M, I found the <a href=”https://aggiecodingclub.com/”>Aggie Coding Club</a> (ACC) which has served as our parent club to this day. With the ACC, I was able to accrue fellow software engineers interested in the idea of a 3D mouse contraption. After consistent member drop offs, our team for the first semester stabilized to three individuals excluding myself. Being new to leadership, and having no idea what I was doing, we barely scraped together a proof-of-concept that had really bad filtering.<br>With this crude glove, many more people joined in the second semester. With an influx from four to ten people and the realization a glove needed to be physically designed, departments were formed. With this new division of expertise, filtering, a display, and a 3D case were made. This new prototype was barely usable, but it showed this idea could actually work.<br>After realizing our member counts would spike again, the third semester marked new departments and department heads. These department heads were trusted individuals with expertise in their field. With them, I was able to attend all my classes and focus on administration and resource issues while they guided new members and led their own work sessions. With over 16 consistently contributing members, we created a prototype I now use in class.<br>This semester rings similar to the others: more people have reached out to join, grand ideas are floating through my head, and we have to restructure again. I have created a team with members specializing in physical creation, 3D design, PCB design, software development, and filtering. Together we have created a unique device that none of us could have individually done.</div>

                <div class="SectionDescription Description">Aggie Bussin is a bus app for designed for A&M's campus. Unlike <a href=”https://aggiespirit.ts.tamu.edu/RouteMap”>current apps</a> that focus on viewing specific busses, this bus app was location based. Entering two locations on a map, it would generate the fastest route using busses to the closest bus stop. This program would effectively operate like google maps and should enable new students to easily find a relevant route. Although unfinished, the sketchy code can be found <a href=”https://github.com/JoshmPerry/AggieBussin”>here</a>.</div>
