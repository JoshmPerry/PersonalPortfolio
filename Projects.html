                <div class="SectionDescription Description">Mouseless Mouse is a glove that transforms hand rotation into mouse movement. It utilizes a BNO086 sensor to calculate the glove's absolute position, then transforms the angle change from resting position into movement. For buttons, the glove has capacitive buttons along the side of each non appendable finger. After connecting this bluetooth device, you enable a new dimension of movement and experience immersion similar to VR.</div>

                <div class="SectionDescription Description">As the inventor of Mouseless Mouse, I have pushed the project beyond an idea and through each iteration. With the Aggie Coding Club, I have created a team with members specializing in physical creation, 3D design, PCB design, software development, and filtering. Together we have created a unique device that isn't commercially available.</div>

                <div class="SectionDescription Description">Aggie Bussin is a bus app for designed for A&M's campus. Unlike current apps that focus on viewing specific busses, this bus app was location based. Entering two locations on a map, it would generate the fastest route using busses to the closest bus stop. This program would effectively operate like google maps and should enable new students to easily find a relevant route.</div>
