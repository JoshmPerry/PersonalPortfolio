                <div class="SectionDescription Description">I am Joshua Perry, a Computer Scientist who loves taking a step back and looking at the broader picture and transforming neat technologies into useful tools. Outside of Computer Science, I love helping others and take pride in my ability to improve other's situations and when I’m too tired for that, you may find me at <a href=”https://www.aggiecatholic.org/”>St. Mary’s</a>.</div>

                <div class="AboutSquigle"></div>
                <div class="SectionDescription Description">Outside of school and personal projects, I am often explaining class concepts to my friends, helping debug other's code, or volunteering at an event. When helping others, my goal is never to "get the work done," but to help them understand how it is done so they can solve future problems. Thanks to A&M's size, there is always more I can do and never a dull moment.</div>

                <div class="SectionDescription Description">I help others and volunteer my time because it's an opportunity for both of us to grow. Not only are they learning new concepts or having their lawn done, but I am also given the opportunity to learn new skills and develop a better character. I get to learn how to teach and learn how to uproot dead trees while helping out the community.</div>

                <div class="SectionDescription Description">I try to face every challenge with a smile and an open mind. As much as I like being grumpy, being negative never makes a situation better. Instead, I try to brighten other’s days with a smile, occasional witty attitude, and calm demeanor.</div>
